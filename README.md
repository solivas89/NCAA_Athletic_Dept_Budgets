# NCAA Athletic Department Budgets for Basketball

## Inspiration
This past year has been a rough year. Everyone is trying to figure out how the Covid-19 pandemic will affect them.
What we wanted to explore in our project (and next project) is how college athletics would be affected by Covid and the current economic landscape.
To do this we looked at:
 * Financial data for NCAA programs that feed pro sports leagues (the NFL and NBA).  
 * Current NFL and NBA Rosters ( to identify the top school that feed these pro sports leagues.
 * Average college athletic budget breakdowns
 * Year-over-year quarterly tax revenue to highlight the financial impacts many of these schools will face in the future. 
 * Leading down this path, our intent is to predict how these leagues and schools will be affected by Covid-19 (Project 3)


## Process
 * Gather data
 * Read in data
 * Data
    ** Parse (multiple data files)
    ** Map data files (implementing key relationships)
    ** GeoCode Data (using Google Maps API)
 * Load cleaned data into MongoDB
 * Build a Flask app that calls data from MongoDB and renders our webpage
 * Add JS libraries for visuals
